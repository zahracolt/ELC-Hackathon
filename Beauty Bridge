## Introduction 

The beauty industry has traditionally been exclusive and limited in its representation of diverse groups of people. Beauty products, shopping experiences, and marketing campaigns often cater to a narrow set of beauty standards and fail to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities. This exclusionary approach leaves many people feeling unseen, unwelcome, and unsupported in their beauty journeys.

This lack of accessibility and inclusivity is a significant problem for several reasons. First, it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and beauty standards that do not reflect the diversity of real people. Second, it limits the economic potential of the industry by failing to serve a significant portion of the population. Finally, it denies people with disabilities the opportunity to enjoy the same beauty experiences as everyone else, leading to a sense of isolation and exclusion.

Addressing this issue is essential to creating a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive beauty industry that serves all people's needs. By developing innovative tools that provide greater accessibility and inclusivity, we can empower more people to feel confident and beautiful in their own skin.
